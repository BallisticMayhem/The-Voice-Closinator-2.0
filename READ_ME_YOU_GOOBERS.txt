In case you dum dums don't know what this does. Well, I'll tell you here since you are big dum dum.

This is an app I made that will pretty much close any window you currently have focused if you say any of the following words you have set up in the list.

And if you are REALLY big dum dum, here is how to use it:

1. Enter the text in the text box and then push Add. This will add the word you have inputted into the list of words that will kill your window if your microphone picks it up.

2. As you will see from starting it up the first time (Or deleting the trigger_words.txt file), you will see "Select me and click delete". It should be simple... just select it and then click Remove Selected.

3. Uhm... There's this old granny up on the top right... She usually likes to change how the application looks or works.

4. The two buttons... Start and stop. You should already know what they do. They start and stop the script. You can even make it kill itself if you keep it focused and say the word. 

5. Now, for the actually kind of useful part. The microphone is automatically set to select your Windows' current microphone input. So, make sure you have the right microphone selected in the windows settings.


Alright you Goofy Goobers, I can now finally give you the "I'm finally not as dum dum as I was before" certification. Now... do whatever I guess...
